Currently unable to run after trying to in eclipse (can no longer find /META-INF/BenchmarkList?), but the source is still here.

According to sources online, each class file *can* be ran as a Java Application in Eclipse, however some issues have arisen from overwriting Maven config files (thanks Eclipse) such that these files can't be ran in VS Code either.

To do so, though, the Java extensions are required.
