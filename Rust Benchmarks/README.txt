Requires an installation of Rust.

When in the benches directory containing 'Cargo.toml', run the command 'cargo bench'.

For the sake of your hard drive, make sure you delete the 'target' folder once you've ran the benchmarks as it can be quite large and is created every time you run the benchmarks anyway.
