Apologies for the messy directory.

Source files are 'main.cc', 'factorialbenchmarks.cc', 'sievebenchmarks.cc', and 'arrbenchmarks.cc'.

An executable can be found inside Release/, and ran with './benchmarks.exe'.

Alternatively, if CMake is installed, run 'cmake --build . --config Release' to build a new executable.
